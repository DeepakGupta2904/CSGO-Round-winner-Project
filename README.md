# CSGO-Round-winner-Project

Overview: This project focuses on predicting round winners in the tactical shooter game CSGO using machine learning algorithms. The objective is to build and compare various machine learning models to classify the round winners based on in-game data. The dataset contains 122,410 records with 97 attributes, detailing different aspects of the game rounds.

Key Tasks:-

1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:-

A. Analyzed and cleaned the dataset to ensure it was ready for modeling.

B. Performed feature selection and engineering to identify the most relevant attributes for predicting round winners.

2. Model Implementation:-

A. Implemented various machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks, to classify the round winners.

B. Compared the performance of these models to determine which algorithm provided the most accurate predictions.

3. Model Evaluation:-

A. Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

B. Conducted cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize the models.
