# CSGO-Round-winner-Project

Tools:- Python (Jupiter Notebook)

Problem Statement:-

The objective of this project is to build and compare multiple machine learning algorithms for the classification of round winners in the game CS:GO.

Dataset Description:-

CS:GO is a tactical shooter, where two teams (CT and Terrorist) play for a best of 30 rounds, with each round being 1 minute and 55 seconds. There are 5 players on each team (10 in total) and the first team to reach 16 rounds wins the game. At the start, one team plays as CT and the other as Terrorist. After 15 rounds played, the teams swap side. There are 7 different maps a game can be played on. You win a round as a Terrorist by either planting the bomb and making sure it explodes, or by eliminating the other team. You win a round as CT by either eliminating the other team, or by disarming the bomb, should it have been planted. CSGO round winner dataset contains 122410 records with 97 attributes.
